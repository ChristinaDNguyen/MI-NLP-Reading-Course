# MI-NLP-Reading-Course

Hello! This repository holds all of the weekly notes and other files related to the NLP course. The 
file structure looks like this:

1. Each week, reading notes will be formatted as this example: "Wk1.Reading1". 
2. For weeks with coding practice, there will also be a "coding practice" file (using code from the texts read) formatted like this example: "Wk1.Coding".
3. For weeks with coding practice that demands picture files (e.g. of graphs), there will be a file formatted like this example: "Wk1.Coding.Image1.Title".
